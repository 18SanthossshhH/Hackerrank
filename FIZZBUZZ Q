#QUESTION:

#Write a short program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line. 
#For each multiple of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
#For each multiple of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
#For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number

    is_divide_by_three = n%3 ==0
    is_divide_by_five = n % 5 == 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if is_divide_by_five and is_divide_by_three :
            print('FizzBuzz')
        elif is_divide_by_three and not is_divide_by_five :
            print('Fizz')
